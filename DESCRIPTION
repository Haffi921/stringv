Description: Set operations on string vectors that work of their canonical equivalence.
    This is identical to base::sets except that strings with special characters (i.e. 'รถ')
    are treated as the same no matter what. This is based on the 'stri_cmp_equiv' function
    from the package 'stringi' <https://github.com/gagolews/stringi>
Depends: R (>= 3.4.3)
Suggested:
	stringi (>= 1.1.6)
